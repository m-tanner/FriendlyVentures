    "bio": "Towards the end of 2018, I was asked to analyze and trend data, past and future, for a rocket engine igniter. I had two options to achieve this goal: do it the usual way or think big. Realizing this, I decided to automate the entire process. This display of ownership along with my excitement to learn something new resulted in a one-touch, web-based interaction to completely analyze and obtain a summary of any number of tests. Recently I leapt into the tech industry, where I've continued to discover that coding combines several of my favorite things: the iterative crafting of expressive phrases, problem solving, and helping others. Whether it’s a project leader, a colleague, or a client, code always seems to help someone and I relish the resulting sympathetic joy.",
